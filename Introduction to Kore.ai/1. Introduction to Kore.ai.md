## Core Concepts in Kore.ai

To effectively build with Kore.ai, it's important to understand its foundational concepts:

### 1. **Bot**
A virtual assistant that can manage tasks, answer questions, and guide users through workflows.

### 2. **Dialog Task**
A flow that defines the structure of a conversation. Each task consists of nodes such as questions, messages, or conditions.

### 3. **Intents**
What the user wants to achieve. Intents are mapped to Dialog Tasks in most cases.

### 4. **Entities**
Information the bot needs to extract from the user, such as dates, names, account numbers, etc.

### 5. **Context**
Used to store user-specific information (session variables, dialog variables) for more intelligent responses.

### 6. **Channels**
Platforms where the bot will be available, such as web chat, email, Slack, or IVR.

## Bot Types in Kore.ai

Kore.ai offers multiple types of bots based on the use case:

### 1. **Standard Bots**
Custom-built from scratch using Dialog Tasks, NLP training, and service integrations.

### 2. **Smart Bots**
Pre-built bots designed for specific industries or domains like banking, HR, or IT helpdesk.

### 3. **Knowledge Bots**
Focus on FAQs, static queries, and information dissemination using a Knowledge Graph.

### 4. **Voice Bots**
Designed for telephony or voice assistants, optimized for ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text-to-Speech).
